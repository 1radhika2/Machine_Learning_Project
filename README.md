Machine Learning Project on "To classify stellar objects into spectrometric classes based on photometric data"
Basically,we take the help of neural networks to classify
an instance whether it belongs to class 0,1 or 2.But,we implement genetic algorithm to find theoptimal weights for the network suited so that it can
fairly classify an instance well.This algorithm proved to be faster for us than other ML algorithms like SVM,KNN etc.
